# react-native-github-notes
A sample github app built with react-native (based on tutorial from https://egghead.io/courses/react-native-fundamentals)

# What I did differently?
I followed the [egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/react-native-fundamentals) course, to build the sample application initially. Then enhanced few things listed below:

- Utilized `NavigationExperimental` so that the base navigation can be used for both `ios` and `android`, and can be connected to redux store.
- Refactored the application data flow using `redux`

There are still a lot of improvement and may different ways to work on this application. This was just a proof of concept to use react-native,  navigator, with redux.
